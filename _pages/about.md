I am a graduate research student in the [College of Information and Computer Sciences](https://www.cics.umass.edu/), [University of Massachusetts](https://www.umass.edu/), advised by [Professor Cameron Musco](https://www.cameronmusco.com). My work focuses on approximating kernel methods, randomized algorithms and online learning. I am especially interested in the over-reaching goal of finding adaptive kernel functions for large datasets.

Prior to this I worked as Visiting Researcher in [Electronics and Communication Sciences Unit](https://www.isical.ac.in/~ecsu), [Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata](https://www.isical.ac.in). with [Professor Dipti Prasad Mukherjee](https://www.isical.ac.in/~dipti/). I completed my Masters in Computer Science in the year 2015, from the same institute. My primary research interest was in non-linear learning models for pre-image computation of image datasets.
