I am a PhD Candidate at the [College of Information and Computer Sciences](https://www.cics.umass.edu/), [University of Massachusetts](https://www.umass.edu/), advised by [Professor Cameron Musco](https://www.cameronmusco.com). My work focuses on approximating kernel methods, randomized algorithms and online learning with applications to real world problems. I am especially interested in the overarching goal of finding adaptive kernel functions for large datasets.

Prior to this I worked as Visiting Researcher in [Electronics and Communication Sciences Unit](https://www.isical.ac.in/~ecsu), [Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata](https://www.isical.ac.in) with [Professor Dipti Prasad Mukherjee](https://www.isical.ac.in/~dipti/). I completed my Masters in Computer Science in the year 2015, from the same institute. My primary research interest was in non-linear learning models for pre-image computation of image datasets.

In my leisure I enjoy playing guitar, badminton and [birding](https://www.instagram.com/ray_archan/). I am an ardent fan of [absurdist fiction](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17690.The_Trial), [philosophical fiction](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4934.The_Brothers_Karamazov), [epic fictions](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31340713-and-quiet-flows-the-don) and graphic novels. I am absolute fan of [Seinfeld](https://www.sonypictures.com/tv/seinfeld) and consider it the pinnacle of observational and conversational comedy.
