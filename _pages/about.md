I am a graduate research student at <a href="https://www.cics.umass.edu/" style="color: blue; text-decoration: none;">College of Information and Computer Sciences</a>, <a href="https://www.umass.edu/" style="color: blue; text-decoration: none;">University of Massachusetts</a>, advised by <a href="https://www.cameronmusco.com" style="color: blue; text-decoration: none;">Professor Cameron Musco</a>. My work focuses on approximating kernel methods, randomized algorithms and online learning. I am especially interested in the over-reaching goal of finding adaptive kernel functions for large datasets.

Prior to this I worked as Visiting Researcher in [Electronics and Communication Sciences Unit](https://www.isical.ac.in/~ecsu), <a href="https://www.isical.ac.in" style="color: blue; text-decoration: none;">Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata</a> with <a href="https://www.isical.ac.in/~dipti/" style="color: blue; text-decoration: none;">Professor Dipti Prasad Mukherjee</a>. I completed my Masters in Computer Science in the year 2015, from the same institute. My primary research interest was in non-linear learning models for pre-image computation of image datasets.
